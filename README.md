A Prism Of Knowledge

Objective
* to explain chemistry ideas and labs using simplified games. Some examples are titration and hydrogen bonding.

Gameplay Mechanics
* It is a single player, minigame collection where the player collects badges based on the games that they collect (for now. maybe a dumb way to die mechanic would be better)
* in Buret, a basic titration occurs where hydronium ions are dropped into a pool of hydroxide ions, and when they collide, a phenolphthalein particle takes it place
* In Hydrate, a bar representing the scale measures the how many white particles, however, the bar moves down and blue water particles get in the way. Acting as fire, the user has to get rid of the water particles so that the actual mass can be measured
* In Tension, hydrogen bonds are created using a click and drag method. The bonds are strong enough to direct objects, treasure chests and anchors.
* In Chromo, you need to sort the randomly formed particles based on their colors using a scrollable set of walls.

Level Design
* The levels each have their own chemistry concept, but they do not follow the same rules as with conventional games

Technical
* Each level has the user interact in a different way.
* There is a main menu which leads to a level select menu. From there you can choose between a game based on titration, on getting the mass of a hydrate, on the strength of hydrogen bonds, and on chromatography
* In Swift, I am using a mainScene class for each scene, with a special orb and arrowRow class for the chromatography scene.

controls
* tapping
* click and drag
