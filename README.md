# Glassware
A Prism Of Knowledge

Objective
* to explain complex chemistry ideas using simplified games

Gameplay Mechanics
* It is a single player, minigame collection where the player collects badges based on the games that they collect (for now. maybe a dumb way to die mechanic would be better)

Level Design
* The levels each have their own chemistry concept, but they do not follow the same rules as with conventional games

Technical
* Each level has the user interact in a different way.
* There is a main menu which leads to a level select menu. From there you can choose between a game based on titration, on getting the mass of a hydrate, on the strength of hydrogen bonds, and on chromatography
* In Swift, I am using a mainScene class for each scene, with a special orb and arrowRow class for the chromatography scene.
